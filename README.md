# HTML Essential Training â€” Trainings, Homework & Project

This repository houses my practice materials, assignments, and final project created during the **[HTML Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/html-essential-training-22425519)** course on LinkedIn Learning. ([Ù„ÛŒÙ†Ú©Ø¯ÛŒÙ†][1])

This course teaches foundational HTML skills from structure and semantics to forms, media, and document organization.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To explore and run your HTML exercises and project:

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hamed1999/html-personal-site.git
   ```
2. **Open files in-browser or via a local server**
   You can directly open `.html` files in your browser, or use a simple HTTP server (e.g. `npx serve`, `python -m http.server`, or VS Code Live Server) to support relative asset loading.
3. **Navigate the folders**
   Each lesson, homework, or project is separated into its own folder, named by topic or module.
4. **Inspect & experiment**
   Use browser DevTools to view the HTML structure, element attributes, and experiment with your own edits.
